this is a bot i made as part of my kodland coding course and its main purpose is to scan images for animals and then give food recommendations based on the data it scans, however there are also some other 
commands that i included just for fun

commands:
.hello - prints a message
.rng - selects a random number between 0 and 2
.heh - prints 'heh' an amount of times specified by the user
